  <h1>No pages, no borders, just content</h1>
  <p>
    Google Docs' pageless mode lets your document flow like a web page: no artificial page breaks, no hard margins, no forced page numbers. It's the modern way to write a document that lives on a screen.
  </p>

  <h2>Why pageless?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Uninterrupted readability</b> - The text runs continuously, keeping the reader's focus.</li>
    <li><b>Tables and images stay whole</b> - Large blocks of data never get split awkwardly across pages.</li>
    <li><b>Scroll‑friendly</b> - Jump to any part of the document with a single swipe or scroll.</li>
    <li><b>Print is optional</b> - Most people never print online documents. If you need a hard copy, you can still do so.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to enable pageless in Google Docs</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open a Google Doc.</li>
    <li>Click File → Page setup</li>
    <li>Check Pageless and hit OK.</li>
    <li>Start writing - the pages are gone.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The future is scroll</h2>
  <p>
    The paper page is a relic of a time when documents were meant to be printed. In the digital age, your document lives in the cloud, on a screen, and is best experienced as a continuous stream. Pageless gives you that experience without any extra tools or hassle.

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <p><b>Is pageless compatible with all Google Docs features?</b></p>
  <p>Yes—tables, images, formatting, and everything else work the same.</p>
  <br />
  <p><b>Can I still print a pageless document?</b></p>
  <p>Absolutely. Export to PDF and print if you must; the pageless view is for on‑screen reading.</p>
  <br />
  <p><b>Does pageless affect collaboration?</b></p>
  <p>No. Collaborators see the same continuous view and can edit normally.</p>
  <br />
